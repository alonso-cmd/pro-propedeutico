    <p id="idParrafo2">Africam Safari started as a private animal collection 
        owned by Carlos Camacho Espíritu, a veteran, pilot, 
        radio host and business man, who lived in Valsequillo, 
        Puebla. Camacho got the idea to create a park where animals 
        could develop and reproduce their species in areas resembling 
        their habitat in the wild. Camacho called this zoo prototype 
        Africam, a portmanteau of Africa (continent where most of the 
        species in the zoo come from) and his last name Camacho.
